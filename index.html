<h1><i>CVU's Nexus</i></h1>

<div>
  <h2>What is Nexus?</h2>

  <p>Nexus is CVU’s personalized learning program which allows students to design and implement a course of their choosing which are tied to CVU’s graduation standards. Each student manages their course, so every student in Nexus will be doing their own project with their own goals</p>

  <h2>What can I do in Nexus?</h2>
  
  <p>Pretty much anything! Anything from STEM to the arts, English to business, practically anything you want. Students meet up with one or more of the three teachers from Nexus and if they approve, then you’re good to go!</p>
  
  <h2>How do I get into Nexus?</h2>
  
  <p>Register with your counselor and sign up for the seminar class.</p>
  
  <h2>What kind of skills do I need?</h2>
  
  <p>The biggest skill needed in Nexus is self-management. Having the ability not only to have a goal for the cycle (which is usually a two-week period) but to also set a pace where you will be learning but not overexerting yourself. The other important skill is communication as not only are the summatives present, but you also have to reach out to people to talk about your project, you have to be able to ask for help, and you have to talk with the Nexus teachers to make sure you’re on a good path.</p>
  
  <h2>What will I practice?</h2>
  
  <p>As well as self-management and communication, two other practices you will learn are reflection and discipline of specific knowledge. Reflection will be practiced at the end of every two weeks or so when every Nexus student writes a blog explaining what they did over the past cycle, how they feel about what they did and where they are, and possible goals for the next cycle. Discipline of specific knowledge is a fancy term for saying how well you can teach others who don’t know about your subject, which most of the time, will be everyone else.</p>
  
  <h2>What kind of credits can I get?</h2>
  
  <p>Most kids get elective credits, however with talking to the teachers, you can get one of the core credits. If you opt for getting a core credit, you may have to add some elements to your project to meet the department learning targets.</p>
  
  <h2>Who are the teachers?</h2>
  
  <p>The three teachers are Amy Wardwell, Peter Booth, and Troy Paradee. You can email them at awardwell@cvsdvt.org, pbooth@cvsdvt.org, and tparadee@cvsdvt.org.</p>
  
  <h2>Can I take Nexus more than once?</h2>
  
  <p>Of course! While Nexus is a semester class, you are able to take Nexus both semesters to continue your learning all year round, and you can take Nexus throughout the years at CVU.</p>
  
  <h2>Do I have to know what I want to do?</h2>
  
  <p>While most students come in with an idea, it is absolutely not necessary to have an idea of what you want to do prior. The beginning of Nexus will have you pinpoint what you want to do, and often times kids who had an idea prior change at this step or alter their ideas.</p>
  
  <h2>What are some past projects?</h2>
  
  <p>Below are a couple of past projects, ranging from literature to biology to mechanics.</p>
